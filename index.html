            <p>A Basilisk (or cockatrice) is a chimeric monster, born from a toad or serpent’s egg incubated under a cockerel. The terrible offspring that hatches from this egg is half-bird, half-snake, and all evil. It is one of the deadliest creatures to menace the mythological world, and it is extremely hostile towards mankind.</p>

            <p>Chimera, in Greek mythology, a fire-breathing female monster resembling a lion in the forepart, a goat in the middle, and a dragon behind. She devastated Caria and Lycia until she was slain by Bellerophon. In art the Chimera is usually represented as a lion with a goat’s head in the middle of its back and with a tail that ends in a snake’s head. This matches the description found in Hesiod’s Theogony (7th century BC). The word is now used generally to denote a fantastic idea or figment of the imagination.</p>

            <p>phoenix (in classical mythology) a unique bird, resembling an eagle but with rich red and gold plumage, that lived for five or six centuries in the Arabian desert (it is also known as the Arabian bird), after this time burning itself on a funeral pyre ignited by the sun and fanned by its own wings, and rising from the ashes with renewed youth to live through another cycle.</p>
